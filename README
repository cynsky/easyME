This is a simple implementation of Maximum Entropy model.
Algorithms implemented include: GIS, SCGIS, LBFGS, Gaussian
smoothing and Exponential smoothing.

We provide ample interface to build your own applications,
please refer to src/maxEntModel.h for more information.

We provide two sample applications at ./examples, one for
training and one for testing.

The folder ./data contains a small test corpus, which is borrowed
from Lin's toolkit

Using the following scripts to build and run our example programs
with the small corpus:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ ./train ./data/train Model
$ ./test Model ./data/test

NOTE: the example programs are likely to be insufficient for your
demands, refer to src/maxEntModel.h and build your own application.

Any problems please contact us: nicyun@gmail.com
